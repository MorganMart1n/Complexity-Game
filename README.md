We used https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout to learn about the setTimeout(); method, I modified the example to set hasShownMonkey to true and to increment currentLevel. </br>
We used https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_break.asp to find out about break; statements as they were needed to exit the collisionWithRects loop early if collision is detected.</br></br>
